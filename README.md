# Hadeer: Employee Attendance Mobile Application (HEAMA)

Hadeer: Employee Attendance Mobile Application is a mobile application where users can record their attendance for entering and leaving their workplace premises without the need for manual attendance tracking. This is because manual attendance tracking is impractical to use. In this context, manual systems are not relevant for use in today's technology. This is due to the majority of people preferring to use online methods for tracking their work hours. Hadeer is an effective application to be implemented in companies or institutions that still rely on manual attendance tracking. By downloading the Hadeer application, users can easily utilize this system to track their attendance. The project aims to achieve success and help build a better solution for attendance tracking.Throughout the development of HEAMA version 1.0.0, HEAMA was only tested to run on android plafform and neveer tested to run on IOS. Below are some of key feature of HEAMA:

- Use Dart (Flutter Framework) to develop mobile application,
